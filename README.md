# Discourse Tagger Plugin

A plugin to allow users to attach labels (so called "tags") to their topics.

## Details


.To Note: this Plugins assumes tags are "moderated", meaning that only staff and users of the trust levels "leader" and "elder" are allowed to add new tags. Normal user can only pick from the list of pre-existing tags.

## Installation

### the official Docker


To install in docker, add the following to your app.yml in the plugins section:

```
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git
          - git clone https://github.com/werweisswas/discourse-plugin-tagger.git tagger
          - cp tagger/db/migrate/* ../db/migrate/
```

and rebuild docker via

```
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```

### Stand-alone

Just two easy steps. From your main discourse do:

    cd plugins
    git clone https://github.com/werweisswas/discourse-plugin-tagger.git tagger  # clone the repo here
    cd ..
    export RAILS_ENV=production                 # set to productions
    cp tagger/db/migrate/* db/migrate/          # copy migrations
    rake db:migrate                             # run migrations
    rake assets:precompile                      # precompile assets
